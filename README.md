# avrSensors
This project is targeted the ATMEGA328P (Arduino Uno) but will work on any AVR ATMEGA device.

This project utilizes the I2C peripheral to talk with Adafruit sensor boards for the Bosch BME280 Temperature/Pressure/Humidity sensor
and the LTR390 UV sensor and also has a simple routine for sending console data through the UART.
